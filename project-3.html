                In my Introduction to Software Engineering class we created a project. This is a team project (5 students per team). The goal is to build a data analytics app mostly from scratch (i.e., without using any database or analytics library). The app provides predefined data analytics for gaining insights from the data. Initially, the app can be populated with some public dataset in CSV format.

              The Homepage is where the user can access all the features of our application. We have a sidebar which accesses the three analytic graphs. 
              Starting at the top we have a toggle button that switches between the Home table and the MVP table. 
              Then we have a search bar where you can search up any player you want. 
              Below we have two drop down filters that will filter the data in the table. The first filter will filter the Year and the second filters based on Teams. Once you’ve inputted those parameters you click the search button and it the page will update with a table that it filtered based on your selections.

              A cool feature on all our graphs and you can see on this graph is when you hover over a part of the graph you can see the data displayed. So my cursor was on the 3rd bar in the graph and it shows the data associated with that part of the graph.

                Our group had a hard time implementing the data flows. After multiple TA office hours here's how we solved it. Data flows to the frontend via get requests. They call a specific backend API which gathers the requested data from the cache to transfer.  Data flows to the backend via Posts, in which the frontend passes comma delimited strings and operation type to the backend to parse out.
