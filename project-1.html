                Rose Hack 2021 was my first ever Hackathon and was hosted online due to COVID-19. I had the opportunity to create a group with some amazing people and design a project targeted for 
                College students. We decided to go with a application used to track COVID-19 symptoms, to be used by schools all over. With it being my first hackathon, I learned to collaborate
                with others and brainstorm ideas together as a team about how the app was to run and look like. Here's a video about our application!

                Many Schools as well as Companies use COVID-19 Symptom Trackers to track employees or students symptom to help decrease the spread of the COVID-19 Virus.
                As a result, they turn to generic Symptom Trackers and require their employees or students to use it daily. We conducted research with a survey to the Rose Hack participants that asks survey trackers
                 if they have ever used the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker provided by their employer or school. Based on the results, we concluded that only 10% of the participants actually used it and this was because
                  of its lack of user friendly features and loses the interest of the users.

                While some university's are providing COVID-19 symptom trackers for their faculty, staff, and students, very few individuals use such tools. To motivate individuals to use such trackers, our app, Divoc gamifies the symptom tracking experience by marking milestones and giving users awards. 
                By being more aware of both one's mental and physical health, Divoc hopes to do its part to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

Viviane and Mansi worked together to set up their environment and link their git commands to VS Code. We are grateful to the mentors that helped us with our challenges.
