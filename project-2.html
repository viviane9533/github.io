                Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI)â€™s mission is to provide a space for young, aspiring computer scientists to succeed by connecting incoming freshmen with like-minded peers and Google engineers in this three-week program.
                During the last week of the program, we teamed up and create programs targeted towards student. My group and I created an app called Lifestyle that can do many things.
                It included a Schedule, a To-Do List and a Task List to make it easier for students to keep track of their everday tasks.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Many students have multiple classes and tasks throughout the school year. Students use organizational apps that will list and organize their tasks and events.
                But many programs only focus on one type of organizational feature. Either just a task list, just a calender, or a to-do list. We conducted a survey and asked 
                which feature people use the most. As a result, the majority of students use all three features.

                While some programs focus on one specific organizational feature, we decided to make an application that includes all. A Task List, A Calender, and a To-Do List, all in one place!

                I was responsible in creating an attractive design for the whole app. I used pastel colors to create the color scheme for the whole app. I referenced this specific
                color palatte.

              The Dashboard was the main page users would see as it is the homepage that links to all features of the app. Since a lot of users where going to see this portion of the application, I wanted to make sure it looked good and was functing well.

              I decided that each feature would have a different color scheme. For example the To-Do list was blue colored and the Calender was orange colored. Here is an example of the Calender.

              The Login Page was the main part of the project I was responsible for. I used HTML/CSS to create all the features and buttons. One part of the project that 
              many liked was the background of the login page. Since the whole program was different colors I decided to have an interactive gradient moving background for the login page.
              As you can see in the video, the login page's background changes colors using all the colors.
